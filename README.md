Title: 2020 Sales Dashboard in Tableau

Description:
In this Tableau project, I delved into a comprehensive sales dataset for the year 2020. The objective was to visualize and understand sales trends, performance metrics, and key insights. Here's a breakdown of the dashboard components:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total sales for the year.
Total items sold throughout the year.

Monthly Sales Trends:

A line chart showcasing monthly sales, allowing users to pick up on sales trends throughout the year. Each data point is labeled with the exact sales figure for clarity.

Sales Change by Month:

A bar chart indicating the percentage difference in sales from the previous month. This provides a quick glance at the growth or decline in sales month-over-month.

Sales by City:

A bar chart breaking down sales figures by city, giving insights into which cities are the top performers and which ones might need attention.

Sales by Salesperson:

A bar chart detailing sales figures by individual salespeople, highlighting top performers and areas for potential improvement.
Interactive Features:

Added a filter for months, allowing users to focus on specific months or quarters. This feature enhances the dashboard's interactivity, enabling users to derive insights for specific time frames.

The design of the dashboard is clean and intuitive, with a consistent color scheme and layout. The aim was to keep it simple yet informative, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with the data could quickly grasp the key insights.
